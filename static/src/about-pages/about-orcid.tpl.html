    <h2>Impactstory and ORCID</h2>

    <h3>Auto-generated profiles</h3>
    <p>
        ORCID users control all access to their data, but many ORCID users choose to make their data public.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've used open data from public ORCID profiles to help us auto-generate some Impactstory profiles. These
        auto-generated profiles help us build robust percentile information, since we can compare any given
        user to a nice large set of scholars at large.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've got an auto-generated ORCID profile, you'll probably want to log in to claim it&mdash;it's
        as simple as logging in to your ORCID account and takes just a few seconds. Once you've logged in,
        you can get start getting email updates on new online impacts, as well as also modify or delete your
        profile if you'd like.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any trouble logging in, just drop us a line and we'll be glad to help.
    </p>
